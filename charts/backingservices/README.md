# BackingServices Helm chart

The Pega Infinity backing service is a feature which you can deploy as an independent service module. For example `Search and Reporting Service` or `SRS` backing service can replace the embedded search feature of Pega Infinity Platform. To use it in your deployment, you provision and deploy it independently as an external service which provides search and reporting capabilities with a Pega Infinity environment.  

The backingservices chart supports deployment options for Search and Reporting Service (SRS). You configure the SRS into the pega namespace for your Pega Infinity deployment.

**Example:**

**_Single backing service shared across all pega environments:_**
You can provision the backingservice `Search and Reporting Service` into your `pega` environment namespace, with the SRS endpoint configured with the Pega Infinity environment. 
When you include the SRS into your pega namespace, the service endpoint is included within your Pega Infinity environment network to ensure isolation of your application data.

### Search and Reporting Service

The Search and Reporting Service provides next generation search and reporting capabilities for Pega Infinity 8.6 and later. 

This service replaces the legacy search module from the platform with an independently deployable and scalable service along with the built-in capabilities to support more than one Pega environments with its data isolation features in Pega Infinity 8.6 and later.
The service deployment provisions runtime service pods along with a dependency on a backing technology ElasticSearch service for storage and retrieval of data. 

#### SRS Version compatibility matrix
Pega Infinity version   | SRS version   | ElasticSearch version     | Description
---                     | ---           | ---                       | ---
< 8.6                   | NA            | NA                        | SRS can be used with Pega Infinity 8.6 and later
\>= 8.6                 | \>= 1.12.0     | 7.9.3                    | Pega Infinity 8.6 and later supports using a Pega-provided platform-services/search-n-reporting-service Docker Image that is tagged with version 1.12.0 and later. Current SRS versions are certified to support Elasticsearch version 7.9.3.


#### SRS runtime configuration:

The values.yaml provides configuration options to define the deployment resources along with option to either provision ElasticSearch cluster automatically for data storage, or you can choose to configure an existing managed elasticsearch cluster to use as a datastore with the SRS runtime. 

If an externally managed elasticsearch cluster is being used, make sure the service is accessible to the k8s cluster where SRS is deployed.

You may enable the component of [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/elasticsearch/values.yaml) in the backingservices by configuring the 'srs.srsStorage' section in values.yaml file to deploy ElasticSearch cluster automatically. For more configuration options available for each of the components, see their Helm Charts.

#### configuration settings:
Configuration                       | Usage
---                                 | ---
`enabled`                           | Enable the Search and Reporting Service deployment as a backing service.
`deploymentName`                    | Specify the name of your SRS cluster. Your deployment creates resources prefixed with this string. This is also the service name for the SRS.
`srsRuntime`                        | Use this section to define specific resource configuration options like image, replica count, cpu and memory resource settings in the SRS.
`elasticsearch`                     | Define the elasticsearch cluster configurations. The [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/elasticsearch/values.yaml) chart defines the values for elasticsearch provisioning in the cluster.
`srsStorage.provisionInternalESCluster` | Enable this parameter to provision an Elasticsearch cluster to be used with SRS. To use your own Elasticsearch service, disable this parameter and use the uncommented section to specify the connection details for your existing external ElasticSearch cluster that is available to your deployment that is using the SRS.

Example:

```yaml
srs:
  enabled: true
  deploymentName: "YOUR_SRS_DEPLOYMENT_NAME"
  srsRuntime:
    #srs-service values
    replicaCount: 2
    srsImage: "YOUR_SRS_IMAGE:TAG"

    resources:
        limits:

        requests:
            cpu: 650m
            memory: "2Gi"
    serviceType: "ClusterIP"
    env:
        #AuthEnabled may be set to true when there is an authentication mechanism in place between SRS and Pega Infinity.
        AuthEnabled: false
        PublicKeyURL:
  
  srsStorage:
    # srsStorage.provisionInternalESCluster true will provision an internal elasticsearch cluster with specified configuration
    provisionInternalESCluster: true
    # set the external Elasticsearch cluster URL and port details below when using an externally managed elasticsearch
    # make sure the endpoint is accessible from the kubernetes cluster pods.
    # Currently the elasticsearch connection does not support any modes of authentication and should be es endpoint APIs' accessible without authentication.
#    domain: managed-elasticsearch.acme.io
#    port: 443
#    protocol: https
#    set `requireInternetAccess` to true when the elasticsearch domain is outside of the Kubernetes cluster network and is available over internet
#    requireInternetAccess: true
